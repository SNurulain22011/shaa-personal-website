            <p >Everyone has a different experience. It doesn't matter what experience, during school, during university or even experience during work. </p>
            <p><br>First, I will tell you about my experience when I was a drop shipper when I was still in school. I used to be a drop shipping agent at a clothing store when I was in highschool. During my work I learned how to communicate with people. I became more punctual and was able to satisfy the needs of the customers. even though it was only for a moment that I became a drop shipping, it was a very giving experience that I have never had.</p>
            <p><br>In addition, during my time at university, I had the opportunity to hold programs in primary schools. This is the low-cost program that I participate in. Many things must be done prior to the program, such as writing official letters and communicating with people of high rank. It gave me the most experience doing this program because I got to meet so many new people.</p>
            <p><br>Last but least, every experience I have had to this day has educated me a lot to be a better human being.</p>
